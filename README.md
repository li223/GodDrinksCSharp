# GodDrinksCSharp
This is a C# implementation of GodDrinksJava which is the code that scrolls through the video to world.execute(me); by Mili. Thanks to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/hibiyasleep/519a7bd3bfc2fd4f7d33f3cbf5cdc3bb) that I stole the original code from.

# Additional
This code is able to be fully compiled and ran, though it doesn't actually do anything.

# Todo
- Somehow make all the if statements return true.
